## 🎄 What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge created by Eric Wastl. Each
December, from December 1st to December 25th, a new **programming puzzle** is
released **daily**. These challenges are designed to help programmers improve
their skills, explore new programming concepts, and have fun while coding.

## 🚀 Purpose of this Repository

This repository is part of my personal language studies where:
- I'll try to implement the solution with different languages
- Enhance programming problem-solving skills
- Practice algorithmic thinking
- Explore different approaches to solving computational challenges
